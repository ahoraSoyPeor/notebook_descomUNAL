\begin{itemize}
\item Given an arbitrary pair of integers $m$ and $n$ with $m > n > 0$:\\
$a = m^2 - n^2$, $b = 2mn$, $c = m^2 + n^2$
\item The triple generated by Euclid's formula is primitive if and only if $m$ and $n$ are coprime and not both odd.
\item To generate all Pythagorean triples uniquely:\\
$a = k (m^2 - n^2)$, $b = k(2mn)$, $c = k(m^2 + n^2)$
\end{itemize}
